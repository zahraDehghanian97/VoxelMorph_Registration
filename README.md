# VoxelMorph_Registration
In this Repo., we are going to train a voxelmorph network to do the unsupervised image registration task. In this project, we use [CHAOS MR T2 dataset](https://chaos.grand-challenge.org/). this dataset contains 20 3D MR images of 20 different patients. Here we use dice score to evaluate our model.
